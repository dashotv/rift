# Rift

Rift is a service that manages downloads from youtube and other sources using the `yt-dlp` library. Particularly,
in addition to handling youtube URLs like other similar services, this service also supports downloading from
`myanime.live`, my source of donghua rips.

This service (similar to all of my other projects) is a testbed for experiemnting with new technologies.
